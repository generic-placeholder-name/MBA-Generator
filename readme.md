# Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (MBA) Expression Generator

This project generates MBAs to obfuscate expressions, providing a powerful tool for software obfuscation and symbolic computation. It supports generating **semi-linear MBAs**.

## Installation

The project is currently in development. To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/generic-placeholder-name/MBA-Generator.git
   ```

2. Build the C++ code inside. 
 
3. Building instructions will be provided once development progresses further.

## TODOs

- [ ] Implement MBA generation using invertible polynomials.
- [ ] Generate polynomial MBAs by multiplying multiple MBAs together.
- [ ] Recursive generation of MBAs for deeper nesting of expressions.
- [ ] Add support for building the project using CMake.
